# Sales Forecasting for a Retail Chain

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for forecasting sales in retail stores. By leveraging historical sales data, we aim to enhance inventory management, optimize resource allocation, and improve financial planning.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Predict sales for retail stores.
- **Data**: Historical sales data combined with store information.
- **Models Used**: Linear Regression and XGBoost.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), RÂ² Score.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for model building and evaluation.
  - `xgboost` for advanced gradient boosting.

## Data Visualization
The project includes several visualizations to explore and understand the data:
- Sales distribution and box plots to display sales data characteristics.
- Bar charts for total and average sales per store.
- Feature importance plots to visualize significant factors in prediction.

## Key Findings

1. **Data Quality**: The dataset includes both store information and historical sales data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Time-related features greatly enhance model performance.
3. **Model Performance**: XGBoost outperforms Linear Regression in most evaluation metrics.

## Next Steps

1. **Model Improvement**: Explore ensemble methods and deep learning approaches.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Develop more intricate features using external data like weather or holiday indicators.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize models further to improve performance.

## Business Impact
- **Inventory Management**: Enhanced stock forecasts reduce overstock and shortages.
- **Resource Allocation**: Better predictions support staff and resource planning.
- **Revenue Forecasting**: Accurate forecasts aid in financial strategy.
- **Marketing Strategy**: Insights support targeted promotions and better decision-making.
